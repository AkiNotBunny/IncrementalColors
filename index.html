    <h1>Incremental Colors</h1>
    <p>Your hands, stained with red and green, ache from the constant escape. </p>
    <p>It's been days since your last real rest.</p>
    <p>You find yourself near a pool of shimmering <span style="color: red">red</span>, nestled between jagged rocks. </p>
    <p>This is what you need. </p>
    <p>The essence of this color is potentâ€”known for its healing properties, a single vial can mend wounds and rejuvenate the spirit. </p>
    <p>Carefully, you pull out a hollowed crystal vial and dip it into the pool. </p>
    <p>The liquid swirls, drawn into the container as though it has a will of its own.</p>

    <p>As you walk away, the colors swirl within you, a constant reminder of the delicate balance you must maintain in this world. </p>
    <p>Too much extraction, and the land will die. </p>
    <p>Too little, and you won't last long enough to see the next sunrise.</p>
